# OCR-for-Sanskrit-using-CNN-and-Deep-Learning

-- Sanskrit is gaining importance in various academic communities due to vast research work written in this language.
    However, the lack of accurately digitized and tagged versions of Sanskrit manuscripts is a major bottleneck. In addition to this, the poor maintenance and text         quality adds to the problem.
-- Essential to digitize such ancient manuscripts which are not only important for research but, are also an important part of the culture and heritage of India.
-- We build an Indic Optical Character Recognition System (OCR), specifically for Sanskrit.
